I was not feeling particularly inspired for this exercise, so I looked through what other students had done to try to find an idea. One student had created a program that would tell you what month you were born in. I immediately thought of horoscopes, and decided to create my own version. The horoscopes I used are from https://www.astrology.com/. The main difficulty I ran into was accounting for both integers and strings, since I wanted the user to be able to write either their birth month or number. In the future, I think it would be cool if you could enter both your birth month and day, since star signs usually begin in the middle of the month.
